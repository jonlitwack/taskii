# Feature ideas submitted by session participants

## Airline booking app to allow us to provide uber style ratings for our fellow passengers so we can see when we book our seat and also on the flight so we can see who to avoid.

## Connected travel modifications - if you change your flight, automatically change the hotel reservation

## Next best option by route - impact of cancelation on hotel, etc - minimizing the negativity of the experience.

## Pain cave - waiting for things. Want transparency, push notifications for everything. Stuck in an elevator, want transparency as to what's going on

## Native trip-it with AI. Travel providers that are connected together - flight is landing, auto join the taxi queue, check in to hotel, etc - connect siloed experiences

## Personalized hotel experiences - if we prefer a room cold, have access to the thermostat . Already logged into Netflix etc in the room.

## Hotels have all the information about prior stays, have your credit card on file. Why isn't the room ready with your preferences - ability to walk out without transactions

## Late hotel checkins - feel compelled to call the hotel so they don't give the room away
## Have food options available for me if I'm arriving late

## hotel, tv doesn't work, towels not there, don't have to wait in checkin line. Get personalized update messages, don't have to talk to people. How many steps does it take.

## When booking an international hotel/airline, get ahead of immigration etc. Like a butler that is always one step ahead of you.

## Airline communications - airline landed early, can't move - any information they can provide the traveler is helpful.

## Book something and something is just not right. Screen is dead in my seat. Find out something doesn't work, make a fuss, presented with options. System could take more proactive steps to let you know. System could give you some optionality.
