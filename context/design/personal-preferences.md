# Personal Preferences System - Taskii

## Overview

Taskii's personal preferences system recognizes that hospitality operations involve diverse roles, work patterns, and individual needs. The system learns from user behavior while providing granular control over how, when, and where users receive information and interact with the platform.

## Core Preference Philosophy

### 1. Operational Context First
Preferences adapt to the operational reality of hospitality work - recognizing that a housekeeper's needs differ from a general manager's, and that preferences may vary by shift, property type, and season.

### 2. Intelligent Defaults
The system provides smart defaults based on user role and property context, then learns and adapts from actual usage patterns.

### 3. Cross-Device Consistency
Preferences sync seamlessly across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices while adapting interface elements to each platform's strengths.

### 4. Privacy-First Learning
The system learns from user behavior to improve experiences while maintaining strict privacy controls and user data ownership.
