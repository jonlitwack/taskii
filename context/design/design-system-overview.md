# Taskii Design System

## Overview

The Taskii design system is built around the core principle of **intelligent hospitality operations**â€”creating clarity from complexity for hotel and travel operations teams. Our design language reflects the sophisticated intelligence of the platform while maintaining the simplicity needed for frontline staff working in fast-paced environments.
