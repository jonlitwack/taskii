# Design System Overview

*A comprehensive design framework for hospitality excellence*

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Hospitality-First Design
Every design decision starts with the question: "Does this make the guest experience better?" We prioritize functionality that enhances service delivery, reduces friction, and enables staff to provide exceptional care.

### 2. Intelligence Made Simple
Complex technology should feel effortless. Our interfaces hide sophisticated orchestration behind intuitive interactions. Users should feel empowered, not overwhelmed, by the system's capabilities.

### 3. Mobile-First Reality
Hospitality happens everywhereâ€”front desk, housekeeping carts, guest rooms, restaurants. Our design system assumes mobile-first usage with seamless transitions between devices and contexts.

### 4. Multi-Property Scale
Solutions must work for a single boutique hotel and a global chain. Our components and patterns scale gracefully while maintaining local personality and operational flexibility.

### 5. Personalized Experience
Every interaction is an opportunity to demonstrate that we know and care about individual preferences. Our design enables mass personalization without sacrificing efficiency or authenticity.
