# User Experience Patterns - Taskii Design System

## Core UX Principles

### 1. Operational Efficiency
Every interaction should reduce friction in hospitality operations, not add complexity.

### 2. Context-Aware Design
The interface adapts based on user role, property type, time of day, operational context, and personal preferences.

### 3. Error Prevention
Design patterns that prevent common mistakes rather than just handling errors after they occur.

### 4. Progressive Training
Embed learning opportunities directly into workflows without disrupting operational tempo.

### 5. Personalized Intelligence
The system learns from user behavior and preferences to provide increasingly relevant experiences.

## Key User Flows

### Task Management Flow

#### Creating Tasks (Property Manager)
1. **Quick Add**: FAB → Task type selection → Auto-populated fields based on type and user history
2. **Bulk Creation**: Template selection → Property/staff assignment → Batch creation
3. **Smart Suggestions**: AI-generated task recommendations based on recent guest feedback and user patterns

#### Task Assignment Pattern
1. **Smart Assignment**: System suggests best-qualified staff member based on skills and current workload
2. **Manual Override**: Manager can reassign with reason tracking
3. **Workload Balancing**: Visual indicators show staff capacity before assignment
4. **Preference Learning**: System learns manager's assignment patterns over time

#### Task Completion (Frontline Staff)
1. **Task Discovery**: Notification (based on user preferences) → App badge → Task list
2. **Execution Guidance**: Task details → Training materials (if needed) → Step-by-step guidance
3. **Completion Verification**: Photo upload → Notes → Status update → Optional peer review
4. **Personal Progress**: Track completion streaks and skill development

### Multi-Property Navigation

#### Property Switching
- **Favorites**: Quick access to frequently managed properties (user-customizable)
- **Recent**: Last 5 properties accessed (personalized)
- **Search**: Type-ahead search by name or location
- **Portfolio View**: Switch to aggregated view across all properties
- **Smart Grouping**: Properties grouped by user's typical work patterns

#### Context Preservation
- Maintain scroll position when switching between properties
- Remember filter/sort preferences per property per user
- Preserve task creation state when interruptions occur
- Sync preferences across all user devices

### Personal Preferences Management

#### Notification Preferences Setup
1. **Initial Setup**: Role-based default preferences during onboarding
2. **Channel Selection**: Email, push, SMS preferences with explanations
3. **Frequency Control**: Real-time, batched, or digest options
4. **Quiet Hours**: Custom do-not-disturb periods
5. **Preview Mode**: Test notifications before saving preferences

#### Preference Learning Flow
1. **Behavior Tracking**: Monitor user response patterns to notifications
2. **Smart Suggestions**: Recommend preference adjustments based on behavior
3. **A/B Testing**: Test notification timing and content optimization
4. **Feedback Loop**: Ask users about notification helpfulness

### Guest Feedback Integration

#### Review Response Workflow
1. **Alert Reception**: Real-time notification based on user's urgency preferences
2. **Impact Assessment**: Automatic categorization and urgency scoring

## Notification System Patterns

### Intelligent Notification Delivery
- **Context Awareness**: Reduce notifications during guest interactions
- **Batching Logic**: Group related notifications to reduce interruption

### User Control Patterns
- **Granular Control**: Individual settings for each notification type
- **Quick Actions**: Snooze, dismiss, or act directly from notifications
- **Batch Management**: Mark all as read, bulk actions on notification center
- **Preview and Test**: Users can preview notifications before saving settings

### Notification Banner System
```
Behavior: Slide down from top, stack by priority
Persistence: Based on notification priority and user preference
Actions: Primary action (blue), secondary action (gray), dismiss (X)
Auto-dismiss: Configurable timing (disabled, 5s, 10s, 30s, never)
Stacking: Maximum 3 visible, others in overflow
```

## Error Prevention Patterns

### Task Assignment Validation
- **Workload Check**: Warn if staff member already at capacity
- **Skill Verification**: Confirm staff has required training for task type
- **Schedule Conflicts**: Alert if assigned during staff member's time off
