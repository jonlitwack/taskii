# Notification Logic - Taskii Design System

## Overview

Taskii's notification system is designed around the operational reality of hospitality environments where timely communication is critical to guest satisfaction and operational efficiency. The system prioritizes contextual relevance over notification volume, ensuring staff receive the right information at the right time without overwhelming them, while respecting individual preferences and work patterns.

## Core Notification Principles

### 1. Operational Context First
- Notifications adapt based on user role, shift timing, current workload, and property context
- Higher priority during peak operational hours (check-in/check-out, meal service)
- Reduced frequency during off-peak hours unless critical
- Guest interaction awareness - minimize interruptions during direct guest service

### 2. Guest Impact Hierarchy
- Direct guest impact takes precedence over internal operational tasks
- Service recovery notifications override routine task assignments
- VIP guest-related notifications receive elevated priority
- Real-time guest feedback triggers immediate response protocols

### 3. Intelligent Personalization
- Respect individual notification preferences and delivery channel choices
- Learn from user response patterns to optimize timing and content
- Adapt frequency based on user's demonstrated attention patterns
- Provide granular control while maintaining intelligent defaults

### 4. Role-Based Relevance
- Corporate users receive strategic/portfolio-level notifications
- Property managers get operational oversight alerts
- Frontline staff receive task-specific, actionable notifications
- Department heads get team-focused operational updates

## Notification Categories & Priority Levels

### Critical (P0) - Immediate Interruption Required
**Triggers:**
- Safety incidents or emergencies
- System failures affecting guest operations
- Regulatory compliance violations
- Severe guest complaints requiring immediate escalation
- Health and safety violations

**Delivery Logic:**
- Override all user preference settings (emergency protocol)
- Push notification + SMS backup + email
- Persistent banner until acknowledged
- Audio alert (respects accessibility preferences)
- Escalation to supervisor if not acknowledged within 5 minutes
- Call/SMS backup after 10 minutes of no response

**Example:**
```
🚨 CRITICAL: Safety incident reported
Property: Downtown Hotel
Location: Floor 3, Room 312
Action Required: Immediate response needed
Estimated Response Time: <2 minutes
[RESPOND NOW] [ESCALATE] [VIEW DETAILS]
```

### Urgent (P1) - High Priority, Persistent Display
**Triggers:**
- Guest complaints/negative reviews requiring immediate attention
- Overdue high-priority tasks affecting guest experience
- Staff safety incidents (non-emergency)
- Equipment failures impacting guest areas
- Occupancy-related critical staffing adjustments
- VIP guest service requests

**Delivery Logic:**
- Respect user's urgent notification preferences
- Push notification (if enabled) + persistent in-app banner
- Email notification to supervisors (if configured)
- Re-alert based on user's escalation preferences (default: every 30 minutes)
- Escalation chain activation after user-defined timeout

**Example:**
```
⚠️ URGENT: Negative review requires immediate response
Guest: Sarah M. (Room 204) - VIP Status
Rating: 1 star on Google Reviews
Issue: "Dirty bathroom, unacceptable"
Service recovery task auto-created
Due: Within 2 hours | Assigned to: Guest Services Team
[RESPOND NOW] [ASSIGN TO ME] [VIEW FULL REVIEW]
```

### Important (P2) - Standard Priority Notification
**Triggers:**
- New task assignments
- Upcoming deadlines (24-48 hours based on user preference)
- Training requirements and certifications due
- Schedule changes and shift updates
- Guest special requests (non-urgent)
- Performance milestone achievements

**Delivery Logic:**
- Follow user's standard notification preferences exactly
- Push notification (if enabled for this priority)
- In-app badge counter
- Email digest option (hourly/daily based on user choice)
- No automatic re-alerts (respects user's batching preferences)

**Example:**
```
📋 New Task Assigned: Deep clean Room 312
Assigned to: Maria Santos
Due: Tomorrow 2:00 PM
Priority: Medium | Estimated time: 45 minutes
Guest checkout inspection required
Training materials: Luxury suite cleaning protocol
[VIEW TASK] [ACCEPT] [RESCHEDULE]
```

### Informational (P3) - Low Priority Updates
**Triggers:**
- Task completions and status updates
- System updates and feature announcements
- Training material availability
- Performance achievements and recognition
- Weekly/monthly summaries and reports
- Team communication and announcements

**Delivery Logic:**
- Respect user's minimal interruption preferences
- In-app badge only (default)
- Optional push notifications (user must opt-in)
- Email digest bundling (daily/weekly based on preference)
- Never interrupt during active work sessions

**Example:**
```
✅ Task Completed: Maintenance Request #1247
Completed by: James Wilson
Room 156 air conditioning repair finished
Duration: 35 minutes | Guest satisfaction: Positive
Guest notification sent automatically
Points earned: +15 | Weekly goal: 85% complete

```

## Contextual Notification Intelligence

### Time-Based Logic

#### Peak Hours (7-10 AM, 3-6 PM, 8-11 PM)
- Reduce non-critical notifications by 60%
- Prioritize guest-facing task notifications
- Batch routine updates for post-peak delivery
- Increase urgency threshold for interruptions
- Respect individual peak hour definitions in user preferences

#### Off-Peak Hours (11 PM - 6 AM)
- Only critical (P0) and urgent (P1) notifications delivered immediately
- All other notifications queued for user's preferred morning delivery time
- Night shift staff receive maintenance and security-focused notifications
- Emergency escalation chains activated more quickly (shorter timeouts)

#### Day-of-Week Intelligence
- **Monday**: Higher priority for weekly planning and goal-setting notifications
- **Friday/Saturday**: Enhanced guest experience and service recovery notifications
- **Sunday**: Maintenance, training, and preparation task focus
- **Holidays**: Elevated guest service notification priority with special event protocols

### Location and Activity Awareness

#### Guest Interaction Detection
- Suppress non-critical notifications when user is in guest areas (GPS-based)
- Delay notifications during check-in/check-out periods
- Silent mode during guest complaint handling
- Emergency notifications always override guest interaction modes

#### Property Area Context
- **Front of House**: Prioritize guest service and experience notifications
- **Back of House**: Focus on operational efficiency and team coordination
- **Guest Rooms**: Minimize interruptions, prioritize safety notifications
- **Common Areas**: Balance guest experience with operational needs

### Workload-Aware Delivery

#### Capacity Management
- Monitor user's current task load and adjust notification frequency
- Delay non-urgent notifications when user is at >80% capacity
- Suggest task redistribution when team members are overloaded
- Learn individual work patterns and optimize accordingly

#### Stress Detection
- Reduce notification frequency during high-stress periods
- Prioritize supportive notifications (help offers, resource availability)
- Escalate more quickly to supervisors when stress indicators are high
- Provide calming notification tones and gentler language

## Personal Preference Integration

### User-Defined Notification Channels

#### Channel Selection by Priority
- **P0 Critical**: SMS + Push + Email (non-negotiable for safety)
- **P1 Urgent**: User choice of 1-3 channels
- **P2 Important**: User choice of 1-2 channels
- **P3 Informational**: User choice of 1 channel or none

#### Custom Delivery Schedules
```
User Example: Front Desk Agent
- Immediate: P0, P1 during shift hours
- Batched Every 30 Minutes: P2 during busy periods
- Daily Digest at 6 AM: P3 informational updates
- Weekend: Only P0 and guest-related P1 notifications
- Vacation Mode: Only true emergencies (P0)
```

### Quiet Hours and Do Not Disturb

#### Flexible Quiet Hours
- Multiple quiet hour periods per day
- Different settings for weekdays vs. weekends
- Seasonal adjustments (busy season vs. low season)
- Emergency override settings with escalation protocols

#### Activity-Based Silence
- Auto-silence during scheduled training sessions
- Meeting mode integration with calendar systems
- Guest interaction detection with automatic quiet mode
- Custom activity tagging for specialized quiet periods

### Learning and Adaptation

#### Response Pattern Analysis
- Track notification open rates, response times, and actions taken
- Identify optimal delivery times for each user and notification type
- Learn which notification content formats are most effective
- Adapt urgency thresholds based on user's response reliability

#### Preference Evolution Suggestions
```
System Learning Example:
"Maria consistently responds to urgent housekeeping tasks within 5 minutes 
during 9-11 AM, but takes 45+ minutes during 2-4 PM. Suggest adjusting 
notification batching during afternoon periods?"

Suggestion: "Batch non-urgent notifications 2-4 PM? You seem to prefer 
focused work time then."
[YES, ADJUST] [NO, KEEP CURRENT] [CUSTOMIZE FURTHER]
```

## Advanced Notification Features

### Predictive Notifications

#### Workload Forecasting
```
Trigger: Analysis shows 15% higher task volume tomorrow
Notification: "Tomorrow looks busy! Consider starting room prep early. 
3 VIP arrivals expected. Would you like to review tomorrow's schedule?"
Timing: End of current shift
Recipient: Housekeeping team leads
```

#### Guest Experience Prediction
```
Trigger: Guest profile + historical data indicates higher service expectations
Notification: "VIP guest Mr. Johnson arriving Room 501. Previous stays show 
preference for immediate service. Preemptive service check recommended."
Timing: 1 hour before guest arrival
Recipient: Guest services manager + assigned room attendant
```

#### Maintenance Forecasting
```
Trigger: Equipment usage pattern analysis
Notification: "HVAC system in Building A showing early stress indicators. 
Preventive maintenance recommended before weekend guest arrivals."
Timing: 48 hours before projected need
Recipient: Maintenance supervisor
```

### Smart Notification Grouping

#### Related Context Bundling
```
Instead of 3 separate notifications:
1. "Room 502 maintenance request"
2. "Room 507 housekeeping needed" 
3. "Floor 5 supply restock required"

Grouped notification:
"3 tasks need attention on Floor 5:
🔧 Room 502 maintenance (AC repair)
🛏️ Room 507 housekeeping (guest checkout)
📦 Floor 5 supplies (linens restock)
Estimated time: 90 minutes total"
[VIEW ALL] [ASSIGN TEAM] [PRIORITIZE]
```

#### Guest Journey Integration
```
Guest-centric grouping:
"Guest Sarah M. (Room 204) needs attention:
📞 Service recovery call pending (negative review)
🛎️ Special amenity delivery requested
🧹 Post-service room inspection recommended
Complete guest recovery workflow?"
[START WORKFLOW] [VIEW GUEST PROFILE] [DELEGATE]
```

### Escalation and Backup Systems

#### Automatic Escalation Logic
```
P0 Critical Escalation:
0 minutes: Assigned staff member (all channels)
5 minutes: Department supervisor (if no acknowledgment)
10 minutes: Property manager + SMS backup
15 minutes: Regional manager + phone call
20 minutes: Emergency contact list activation

P1 Urgent Escalation:
30 minutes: Department supervisor notification
2 hours: Property manager alert
4 hours: Include in daily management report
```

#### Cross-Coverage Notifications
```
Scenario: Assigned staff member is unavailable
System Logic:
1. Identify qualified team members in same department
2. Check current workload and availability
3. Send notification to best available substitute
4. Notify original assignee when they return
5. Update all stakeholders on reassignment

Notification: "Maria (original assignee) is in training. James, you're 
the best available team member for Room 312 deep clean. Accept assignment?"
[ACCEPT] [SUGGEST ALTERNATIVE] [DELAY UNTIL MARIA AVAILABLE]
```
