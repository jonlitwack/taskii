# Notification Logic - Taskii Design System

## Overview

Taskii's notification system is designed around the operational reality of hospitality environments where timely communication is critical to guest satisfaction and operational efficiency. The system prioritizes contextual relevance over notification volume, ensuring staff receive the right information at the right time without overwhelming them.

## Core Notification Principles

### 1. Operational Context First
- Notifications adapt based on user role, shift timing, and current workload
- Higher priority during peak operational hours (check-in/check-out, meal service)
- Reduced frequency during off-peak hours unless critical

### 2. Guest Impact Hierarchy
- Direct guest impact takes precedence over internal operational tasks
- Service recovery notifications override routine task assignments
- VIP guest-related notifications receive elevated priority

### 3. Intelligent Batching
- Group related notifications to reduce interruption frequency
- Batch routine updates during natural workflow breaks
- Never batch critical safety or guest complaint notifications

### 4. Role-Based Relevance
- Corporate users receive strategic/portfolio-level notifications
- Property managers get operational oversight alerts
- Frontline staff receive task-specific, actionable notifications

## Notification Categories & Priority Levels

### Critical (P0) - Immediate Interruption Required
**Triggers:**
- Safety incidents or emergencies
- System failures affecting operations
- Regulatory compliance violations
- Severe guest complaints requiring immediate escalation

**Delivery:**

- Audio alert (if enabled)
- Escalation to supervisor if not acknowledged within 5 minutes

**Example:**
```
🚨 CRITICAL: Health inspection violation reported
Property: Downtown Hotel
Action Required: Immediate response needed
Tap to view details and assign corrective tasks
```

### Urgent (P1) - High Priority, Persistent Display

## Contextual Notification Logic

### Time-Based Intelligence

#### Peak Hours (7-10 AM, 3-6 PM, 8-11 PM)
- Reduce non-critical notifications by 60%
- Prioritize guest-facing task notifications
- Batch routine updates for post-peak delivery
- Increase urgency threshold for interruptions

#### Off-Peak Hours (11 PM - 6 AM)
- Only critical and urgent notifications delivered immediately
- All other notifications queued for morning delivery
- Night shift staff receive maintenance-focused notifications
- Emergency escalation chains activated more quickly

#### Day-of-Week Patterns
- **Monday**: Higher priority for weekly planning notifications
- **Friday/Saturday**: Enhanced guest experience notifications
- **Sunday**: Maintenance and preparation task focus
- **Holidays**: Elevated guest service notification priority

### Role-Based Notification Routing

## Intelligent Notification Features

### Predictive Notifications

#### Workload Balancing
```
Trigger: Staff member approaching capacity (>80% of average daily tasks)
Notification: "Maria has 8 tasks due today. Consider reassigning Room 204 cleaning?"
Recipient: Housekeeping supervisor
Timing: 2 hours before shift capacity typically reached
```

#### Guest Experience Prediction
```
Trigger: Pattern recognition - guest complaint likelihood elevated
Notification: "VIP guest in Room 501 - similar profile had service issues. Preemptive service check recommended."
Recipient: Guest services manager
Timing: Within 1 hour of guest arrival
```

#### Seasonal/Event Adjustments
```
Trigger: High occupancy event approaching (convention, holiday)
Notification: "Spring conference starts tomorrow. 15% increase in housekeeping tasks projected. Additional staff recommended."
Recipient: Operations manager
Timing: 24 hours before event
```

### Smart Notification Grouping

#### Related Task Batching
- Group notifications for same guest/room
- Combine routine maintenance notifications
- Batch training reminders by department
- Consolidate daily assignment notifications

#### Location-Based Grouping
```
Instead of: 3 separate notifications for Floor 5 issues
Grouped as: "3 tasks require attention on Floor 5: Room 502 maintenance, Room 507 housekeeping, Floor 5 supplies restock"
```

#### Time-Sensitive Clustering
```
Bundle: All tasks due within next 2 hours
Format: "4 urgent tasks due by 3 PM: Guest checkout preps (2), Maintenance calls (1), Guest request (1)"
```

### Notification Personalization

#### Learning User Preferences
- Track notification response patterns
- Adapt timing based on user activity
- Adjust urgency thresholds per individual
- Remember preferred communication channels

#### Cultural and Language Adaptation
- Multi-language notification support
- Cultural context for international properties
- Time zone intelligence for global brands
- Local compliance requirement awareness

## Banner Notification System

### Persistent Banner Logic

#### Display Rules
- Maximum 3 banners displayed simultaneously
- Priority-based stacking (P0 on top)
- Auto-dismiss after resolution
- Manual dismiss option for non-critical items

#### Banner Hierarchy Display
```
[P0 Critical Banner - Red background, urgent icon]

#### Banner Actions
- **Primary Action**: Direct resolution (complete task, respond to guest)
