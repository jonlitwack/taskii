## Title

Taskii Operations and Migration Strategy

## Description

Operational monitoring, analytics, and phased migration from prototype to production.

## Monitoring and Analytics

- **Task Completion Metrics**: On-time vs delayed by property and task type
- **User Engagement**: Training completion rates, task acceptance rates
- **Operational Intelligence**: Predictive alerts for staffing gaps, maintenance needs
- **Guest Satisfaction Correlation**: Link task completion to review score improvements

## Migration Path

The architecture extends the enterprise standards' prototype:

1. **Phase 1**: Enhance data model from Todo to full Task entity
2. **Phase 2**: Add property management and user roles
3. **Phase 3**: Integrate guest feedback sources
4. **Phase 4**: Implement AI-driven task generation
5. **Phase 5**: Deploy real-time notification system

This approach ensures the system evolves from the proven standards while meeting the hospitality industry's complex requirements.
